===================

Dependencies :
You must install this -> https://developers.google.com/gdata/articles/php_client_lib?hl=fr and make the PHP PATH point to it somehow (see link)

A Picasa Account is also needed, and must be provided in the form of a file named "userinfos" and containing the username and password, each on a different line.
